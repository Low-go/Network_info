# Network_info
File that retrieves all the ip addresses connected in a network. Will update in the future to include other things

Simply Run it and it will automatically retrieve your default_gateway and subnet mask and utilize it to find all the hosts connected to your network though 
nmap.

Hope to add other types of information in the future

#Note

For now it functions if you have a Nmap.exe file in your path/ environment variables.
